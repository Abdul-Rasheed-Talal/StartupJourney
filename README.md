# ðŸš€ My Startup Journey â€“ Abdul Rasheed Talal

**Age:** 17  
**From:** Pakistan  
**Started on:** July 7, 2025

## ðŸŽ¯ My Mission

To build a tech company that helps talented people in backward areas of Pakistan by providing IT jobs, real-world training, and opportunity.

I have no money. I have no connections. But I have a dream â€” and I will not stop.

## ðŸ“˜ Why I'm Doing This

Because too many people around me have skills but no platform.  
Because I'm tired of waiting for change â€” I want to create it.
