# ðŸš€ Abdul Rasheed Talal â€“ My Startup Journey

**Age:** 17  
**Location:** Backward area of Pakistan  
**Started:** 7 July 2025

## ðŸŽ¯ Mission

I want to build my own tech company to support the youth of backward areas in Pakistan.  
Where there is talent but no support, I will create opportunity.  
Even if I have to walk alone â€” I will.

## ðŸ’¡ Why?

Because:
- I believe even without money, I can still build something great.
- People around me are skilled but donâ€™t get a chance.
- No one is coming to help us â€” *so I will become the one who does.*
